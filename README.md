# Overview:
<br>
We have created a Video Gaming Search application that allows users to search nearly any video game of their choice. Upon searching, the user's search returns screenshot images, a description of the game, the ESRB rating, current reviews of the games. Also, our webpage allows a user to be directed to a Free To Play page where a user may browse Free To Play games.
